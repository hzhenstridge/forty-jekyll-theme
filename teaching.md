		<h3>Supplemental Instruction, UCSD</h3>
		</p>I served as a SI Leader and Couse Leader helping students better understand curriculum and course material through facilitation and scaffolded instruction. This included attending lectures, taking notes, and creating 80-minute session plans weekly that were relevant to the current course topic. As a leader, I facilitated two sessions per week, assisted students in lecture, and answered student questions. As a course leader, I supervised other leaders by providing guidance on session plans, observing their sessions and providing feedback for improvement. I also planned weekly team meetings for training and community building.</p>
