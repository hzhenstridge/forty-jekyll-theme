		<h3>Neurophysics - Dr. William Kristan, UCSD</h3>
		</p>I designed and executed my own research experiment to measure phototaxis of planarians temporally and spatially, including how their replication affects their phototaxis. I did this by creating varying light gradients for planarians; establishing a system of computers, computer programs, a handheld projector, camera, and microscope; utilizing microscopy techniques to record the planarians movement and analyze their phototaxis after experimentation.</p>

		<h3>Materials Physics - Dr. Olivia Graeve, UCSD</h3>
		<p>I collaborated in writing a literature review about optical, magnetic, and electrical properties of ceramic metal oxides by reading, summarizing and articulating to peers and supervisors the relevant conclusions and topics of relevant papers. I also worked on the creation of a database of properties of carbide materials for aerospace purposes.</p>

		<h3>Condensed Physics, Dr. Leonid Butov, UCSD</h3>
		<p>I aligned optical equipment, performed data analysis of a CCD camera using Python, and collected data using a computer program to take CCD images of a laser-excited sample. I collaborated with graduate students on experiments on the effects of varying magnetic fields and laser excitation power on exciton transport. This involved training in the usage of cryogenics, CCD usage/analysis, and laser excitation.</p>

		<h3>Earth Science, UCSB - Dr. Zach Eilon</h3>
		</p>As the global climate crisis grows, many industries have started transitioning to clean and renewable energy. This brings new technological and resource challenges to the forefront. Many clean energy technologies depend on ‘battery metals’ which are crucial to power generation and components of ‘green’ systems [1]. Minerals that are formed or present in the shallow crust, such as epithermal gold, iron, copper, and platinum, can be found through airborne geophysics and remote sensing due to their magnetic susceptibility and/or electrical conductivity, but these comprise only a small percentage of Earth’s mineral potential. New geophysical imaging methods have begun to emerge to meet the challenge of prospecting for critical minerals. For instance, ambient noise tomography (ANT) can be used to find deposits around 750-meters below sedimentary deposits [5]. This method has proven useful in successful deep cover mineral expeditions, but it is impacted by inherent limitations of ANT, for instance inability to properly resolve seismic anisotropy [4]. The EilonLab at UCSB has created a novel 3-D seismic model of the conterminous US with an unprecedented combination of lateral and vertical detail [3]. The model is formed by simultaneously inverting 9 independent seismologic datasets for shear velocity (and radial anisotropy) across 1700 seismic stations using a transdimensional hierarchical Bayesian inversion [2]. This is the most advanced and complete model of its type to date, unique for its combination of data types, sophisticated probabilistic approach, incorporation of radial anisotropy, and sensitivity to deep plate structure. Crucially, it reveals new information about the “lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary” (LAB) region: the base of the North American plate. I propose to interrogate this model using ML tools to prospect for critical minerals within the North American continent. If successful, my approach would allow for increased supply of critical metals found and mined responsibly within the United States.</p>
